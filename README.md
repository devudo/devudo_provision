DEVUDO PROVISION
================

This code will be present on all Devudo Devmaster servers.

Essentially all it does is provide a copy of the command
"hostmaster-install" called "devmaster-install".

This allows us to choose our own installation profile to run.

Eventually this drush module will be used to callback to shopmaster
and perform other magic specific to devudo devshops.
